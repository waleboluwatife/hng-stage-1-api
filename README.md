## Description

This API takes an integer as input and returns various properties, including:
*   Whether the number is prime or not
*   Whether the number is a perfect number
*  Armstrong status
*   A list of number properties (armstrong, odd, even)
*   The sum of its digits
*   A fun fact about the number.

The API utilizes external resources to get the fun fact by calling [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/#42).

## Features

-   Accepts GET requests with a `number` parameter.
-   Returns responses in JSON format.
-   Provides appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for success, 400 for bad request, 500 for server error).
-   Includes a fun fact about the given number using Numbers API.
-   Handles CORS to be accessible from different origins.

## Technology Stack

-   Python 3.6+
-   Flask (for web framework)
-   requests (for fetching fun facts from the Numbers API)
-   Flask_CORS (for enabling CORS)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.6+
-   pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-github-repo-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the API Locally

To run the API locally:

```bash
python3 app.py
Use code with caution.

API Usage
Endpoint
GET /api/classify-number

Request Parameters
number (required): An integer value for the API to classify.

Response Format
Successful Response (200 OK)
{
    "number": 371,
    "is_prime": false,
    "is_perfect": false,
    "properties": ["armstrong", "odd"],
    "digit_sum": 11,
    "fun_fact": "371 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371"
}
Use code with caution.
JSON
Error Response (400 Bad Request)
{
    "number": "alphabet",
    "error": true,
